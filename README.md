# Whiskey Herald

Whiskey Herald is a collaborative community where users can contribute to updating a database with information on all their favourite whiskeys. 
This should facilitate community building and provide a meaningful experience to the user. A user can then leave reviews of their favourite whiskeys
 with CRUD functionality on their own reviews.
 The project should be of interest to new users looking to become a part of the whiskey enthusiast community, and 
 veteran users who want to maintain a strong community and share their own thoughts of their favourite whiskeys.


# UX

## Project Goals

-	Develop a website with an intuitive design that helps the user accomplish their goals. [1]
-	Provide the user with a meaningful experience. [2]
-	Build a website in line with good coding practices. [3]

## User Goals

-	Provide filtered lists of whiskeys that may appeal to various user interests. E.g. Sort whiskeys by type, rating, most reviews, etc. [4]
-	Search the database with custom keywords.  [5]
-	A website with a familiar enough design that I can focus on accomplishing my goals rather than learn how to use the website. [1]
-	Feel that use of this website is a meaningful use of my time. [2]
-	Accessible design. [6]

[1] Following Jakob’s law I will use Bootstrap to customise my website with well used and tested designs so that a user can immediately begin to accomplish their goals rather than risk them being overwhelmed with having to learn how to navigate an unfamiliar website.
[2] All users will be able to update the information on whiskeys so that the database is up to date and they may contribute to a community of like-minded individuals.
[3] HTML and CSS will be passed through validators, JavaScript will be passed through a linter, and Python will be written in accordance with PEP8 practices.
[4] The home page will feature some filtered whiskey lists that a user may scroll through.
[5] The user will be provided with a search bar that will allow them to navigate the database for what they are looking for.
[6] The website will adhere to good practices for ensuring that it is accessible for users with visual impairment.
